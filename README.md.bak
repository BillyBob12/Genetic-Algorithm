# Genetic-Algorithm

First, run the program unigram.py, Bigram.py, and the Trigram.py to select the condidate sentiment words
	the unigram.py is to generate the unigrams
	the Bigram.py is to generate the bigrams
	the Trigram.py is to generate the trigrams



the Mutation_Guide.py is to guide the mutation process

the Replacers.py is to replace the abbreviations

The Genetic_Algorithm_1.py is the Algorithm1 in this work

The Genetic_Algorithm_2.py is the Algorithm2 in this work
